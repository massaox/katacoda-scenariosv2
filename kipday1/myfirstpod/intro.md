Welcome to your first workshop! As we have just learned Pods are the building blocks of Kubernetes. Pods are an abstraction where one or more containers can be placed within. And Namespaces are great for keeping your Kubernetes cluster organized, creating a divide between different environments you might setup in your cluster e.g "production" and "staging" environments.

It is time for us to practice our newfound knowledge. Don't worry, we will start very simple and build up from here as we move along throughout the day.
