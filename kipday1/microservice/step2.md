Did you run into an issue trying to add something to your cart? I hope so because that was the plan. There are a few things broken in the application and your goal is to figure what until you are able to successfully add something to your cart and purchase the item.

Hopefully with all the knowledge we gathered today we will be able to solve this one.  There will be not much guidance this time. We can all help each other feel free to ask for help or voice any ideas you have on what you think it maybe be wrong.

All the manifests required by the application are located under "/root/manifests/" if you want to consult them.

Don't worry if you struggle, this scenario was designed for you to ask questions along the way. It would be pretty difficult to do all on you own.

When you finally able to buy any items you wish from the shop congrats! You have made it!
