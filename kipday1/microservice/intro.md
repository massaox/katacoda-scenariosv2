Welcome to our last scenario of the day.  This time we will be working with a fully functional e-commerce website completely build using a microservice architecture and packaged for Kubernetes. Every microservice consist of a service object so each microservice can use to communicate with each other and a deployment even if they are supposed to run only on replicat, that way if the POD dies it will be the replicaSet controlled by the deployment object will take care of created a new Pod for us. I hope you will enjoy!
